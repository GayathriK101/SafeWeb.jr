# SafeWeb.jr
Protect your kids online - RESPECTFULLY !!

*SafeWebJr* is an early-stage child safety monitoring project designed to help parents protect their kids from explicit content and online threats â€” with ethics and empathy at the core.  

We believe that online safety should never come at the cost of a childâ€™s privacy or autonomy. SafeWebJr is built to be transparent, respectful, and empowering for both parents and children.
